To install SSH on Debian, you need to install the OpenSSH server package. The process is as follows:

1. Update your package list with:
```
sudo apt update
```

2. Install the OpenSSH server:
```
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

3. After installation, check that the SSH service is running:
```
sudo systemctl status ssh
```
You should see `Active: active (running)` if itâ€™s running.

4. If the service is not active, start and enable it to run on boot:
```
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl enable ssh
```

This will install and enable SSH on Debian 9, 10, 11, or newer versions. You can now connect remotely to your Debian machine via SSH on port 22 by default.[1][2][3][4]

If the Debian machine has no internet connection, you can download the openssh-server `.deb` package on another machine, transfer it over, and install it using `dpkg -i`.[5]
